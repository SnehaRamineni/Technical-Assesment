-- Given a schema of Authors and Publications described below,
-- please complete the following questions

Authors
	Id	int primary key (not null)
	FirstName	varchar(50) (not null)
	LastName	varchar(50) (not null)

Publications
	Id	int primary key (not null)
	Title	varchar(100) (not null)
	PublishDate	datetime2(2) (not null)
	AuthorId	int (null)



-- 1. Write a query to return all the Authors and include the Publish date of their most recent publication.

select A.*, P.PublishDate from Authors A join Publications P on P.AuthorId = A.Id 
JOIN
(   SELECT  AuthorId, MAX(PublishDate) AS RecentPublishedDate
    FROM    Publications
    GROUP BY AuthorId
) AS RecentPublished
    ON RecentPublished.AuthorId = P.AuthorId
    AND RecentPublished.RecentPublishedDate = P.PublishDate;
	


-- 2. Rewrite the query from #1 to also include the Title of their most recent publication.

select A.*, P.PublishDate, P.Title from Authors A join Publications P on P.AuthorId = A.Id 
JOIN
(   SELECT  AuthorId, MAX(PublishDate) AS RecentPublishedDate
    FROM    Publications
    GROUP BY AuthorId
) AS RecentPublished
    ON RecentPublished.AuthorId = P.AuthorId
    AND RecentPublished.RecentPublishedDate = P.PublishDate;



-- 3. Write a query to find any records in Publications that are missing an Author record.


select P.* from Publications P where AuthorId not in (select A.Id from Authors A)

-- 4. Write the query for #3 above in a different way.


Select p.* from Publications P
Except
SELECT P.*
  FROM Publications P
       Inner JOIN Authors A
          ON P.AuthorId = A.Id

-- 5. Describe what indexes would help the performance for the queries you wrote above.

Creating non clustered index for LastName in AUthor table would help for fast search
Also, Creating non clustered index for AuthorId in Publications table would help
